# casinoGame GraphQl React.js Node.js PostgreSQL


## Make sure to setup PostgreSQL for the GraphQL server
:wave: :information_desk_person: :information_desk_person: :information_desk_person:
1. Install PostgreSQL on your computer
2. Create database called `casinoGame`
3. Navigate to `server` and `web` folders and press `yarn` or `npm install` 
4. Set config for database  with the username `postgres` and password no `admin`. (You can change what these values are in the [ormconfig.json](https://github.com/benawad/graphql-ts-server-boilerplate/blob/master/ormconfig.json))
5. in line `120` in file `server/sr/UserResolver.ts` make sure to change permision in `user.Admin` first to have a role for admin and see add Post and add Game.
6. Application need just to implement subscription wtit GrahpQL, but I'm runing out of time. :relieved: :relieved: :relieved:
